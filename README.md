This project utilizes the viewport tag and media queries to create a mobile responsive website. This means the website will render correctly regardless of the device that one uses to view it. While the Bootstrap Framework automatically does this (for the most part), one must manually add @media content to his/her HTML and CSS sheets in order to achieve mobile responsiveness.
